# Rugby GraphQL API

This repo followed the **Intro to GraphQL with Java & DGS** [course lessons and instructions](https://apollographql.com/tutorials/intro-dgs) on Odyssey, [Apollo](https://apollographql.com)'s learning platform.

Intended as a foray into Java and GraphQL, this interacts with the [API Sports](https://api-sports.io/) Rugby API and returns team data organized in an intuitive way to allow someone to easily create a calendar application for teams.

## How To Use This Repo

TBD!
